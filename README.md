# skal-vi-rede-klimaet-nu
This repository contains the source code of [skalviredeklimaet.nu](https://skalviredeklimaet.nu/). For non-Danish speakers, the name of the site reads "Should we save the climate now?", while the page contents simply read "Yes".

I had been waiting for an excuse to try out Gatsby and Netlify, and with the [2019 Danish general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Danish_general_election) announced this week, I finally got a chance.

This site format is pretty stupid, but acts perfectly well as a Hello World sample for testing out new technologies. It is relatively well known in Scandinavia, examples including https://erdetfyraften.dk/, http://www.erdetjul.nu/ and https://erdetfredag.dk/.
